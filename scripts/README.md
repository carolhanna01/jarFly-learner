Here you can find the relevant bugs from the Defects4J bachmark that we used in our experiments, as well as the scripts to launch the repair attempts and evaluate the resulting patched.

# Directory structure:

**analyze_patches**: scripts for creating and evaluating the patch files.

**bugs**: for each RQ, the names of bugs from the Defects4J benchmark that were used for evaluation.

**execute_repair**: scripts for executing the repair attemps on specific bugs.

**organize_to_jobs**: not relevant for replication purposes as they are suitable for the compute node cluster environment that we were specifically using.

**statistical_analysis**: scripts for collecting statistics from results.
