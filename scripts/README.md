Here you can find the relevant bugs from the Defects4J bachmark that we used in our experiments, as well as the scripts to launch the repair attempts and evaluate the resulting patched.

The [prepare_bug_experiment](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/blob/operator-selection/scripts/prepare_bug_experiment.sh) and [repair_bug_experiment](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/blob/operator-selection/scripts/repair_bug_experiment.sh) scripts are a modified version of the (prepare_bug)[https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/JavaRepair-replication-package/blob/master/src/repair-technique-execution/prepare_bug.sh] and [repair_bug](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/JavaRepair-replication-package/blob/master/src/repair-technique-execution/repair_bug.sh) scripts from the [JarFly replication package](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/JavaRepair-replication-package).

Scripts in the [organize_to_jobs](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/tree/operator-selection/scripts/organize_to_jobs) folder are not relevant for replication purposes as they are suitable for the compute node cluster environment that we were specifically using.
