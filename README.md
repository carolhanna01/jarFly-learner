This repository is for the paper "Optimising Mutation Operator Selection for Automated Program Repair with Reinforcement Learning" paper by Carol Hanna, Justyna Petke, and Aymeric Blot, as a part of an MSc Software Systems Engineering final dissertation at University College London.

This is a modified version of the [JarFly framework](https://github.com/squaresLab/genprog4java) in which we implement our approach.

Our additions to the repository structure:

[Reports](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/tree/operator-selection/reports): the dissertation report (pending) + systematic overview of the tools that we considered as well as the results of our literature review.

[Results](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/tree/operator-selection/results): includes the plots and the patches that were produced using our technique. 

[Scripts](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/tree/operator-selection/scripts): the scripts we used for running the probability matching, adaptive pursuit, UCB, and epsilon-greedy experiments. Additionally, the scripts that we used for evaluating the patches.

The implementation of the approach are in the [source files](https://github.com/carolhanna01/jarFly-learner/tree/operator-selection/results) of JarFly.
