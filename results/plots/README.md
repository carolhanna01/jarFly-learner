RQ1-3 incldes:
* All credit distribution plots per variant number for experiments with average credit assignment evaluated on the 49 bugs that were patched by GenProg in original JarFly paper.
* All credit distribution plots per variant number for experiments with exponential recency-weighted average credit assignment evaluated on the 49 bugs that were patched by GenProg in original JarFly paper.
* A boxplot comparing the median variant numbers for the patches for all experiments from RQ1-3
* Venn diagram of the bugs patched in the experiments with average credit assignment
* Venn diagram of the bugs patched in the experiments with exponential recency-weighted average credit assignment

fine_tuning includes:
* All credit distribution plots per variant number for all learning rate fine tuning experiments (that were run with the subset of 5 bugs).
